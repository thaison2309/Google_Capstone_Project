## Introduction
 - This is a case study stimulates a business-related scenario where I am a junior data analyst helping a bike rental company conducting a research into their customers behaviour.
 - The case study is to answer the question  “In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?” for futher detail about the context of the case study please visit this link [Google Cyclistic Case Study](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/aacF81H_TsWnBfNR_x7FIg_36299b28fa0c4a5aba836111daad12f1_DAC8-Case-Study-1.pdf?Expires=1650067200&Signature=EXlwGbfl6f9eLneN0YSKR4B2WHPfKM8THQlw7RVA-elH9Qvrj0STLiIqWGyRlu0FEV94388fnxuF5XI30Ukwdbu2U9-Qs1w0AR~ywdKHem9STC9ZxTJwYiNy1wJvgCqVYno5f9B2dej3wRMswlh0-FRv2eWwOo0qXf7VDUAl9bA_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)

## Problems
 - As stated above the case study is to analyze the company customer behaviour on bike renting and then propose some approaches for the company to launch its marketing campaign.
 - The data required for the project can be download via this [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). My project focus on four files which are:
   + [Divv_Trips_2019_Q2](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.zip)
   + [Divv_Trips_2019_Q3](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.zip)
   + [Divv_Trips_2019_Q4](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.zip)
   + [Divv_Trips_2021_Q1](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.zip) 
 - The tool I use in this project is R programming language, an open-source, efficient language for data analytics
 - The processing phase of the project has solved many issues with the data frames such as different column numbers, names; combining all data source into one **consistent** data frame; extracting utilizable data; removing unwanted data.
 ## Solutions
  - R programming language offers a wide range of data manipulating libraries so that I could use and tackling the aforementioned problems
  - I also utilize some librares to analyze data (calculating mean for each type of users) and then visualize the result for further analysis
  ## Conclusion
   - After a lot of data cleaning and analyzing, I could finally create some data visualizations out of the dataset:
